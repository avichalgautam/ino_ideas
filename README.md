### Project Definition:
      This web application is based on the health and fitness, specially for old people who are dependent on their children to go to the doctor. But due to 24*7 hectic schedule, their problems are generally neglected. Our idea is to provide an online platform, where the details of the patient will be saved and can be reviewed by the doctor to whom they consult. In addition, any symptoms or problems faced by the patient before the next appointment, it can be added by the patient or his family to the website. The doctor will get a notification. If there will be something serious, the doctor can contact the patient for immediate action and emergency cases can be dealt. 
   *   The primary principle of our project is to promote health care without getting the user in any mess.
   *   Connecting patient to doctors even in the remote areas.
   *   An organized structure to approach a doctor.
   *   Patients medical history is maintained well.   
   *   Improved doctor and patient's communication.
   *   Specially for Lazy people (Not conscious about their health)
   
### Objectives:
   * Application will contain a login page.
   * The doctor will be having account on it.
   * Patient's account will contain all his details, previous medical history etc.
   * The record of all the patients of that particular doctor will be shown to him. This way, the data is appropriately managed.
