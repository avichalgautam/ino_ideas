### Project Defination:
      Itâ€™s a remorse that despite decades of developing health infrastructure, "Health for All" has just remained a slogan. All over the world there are government health programmes, assembled at huge expense, meant for all and available to all. There are NGOs, international agencies and governments focused on health. Billions of dollars have been invested in health programmes by the World Bank, Global Fund and international aid agencies but due to lack of awareness among flock these --- get unnoticed
  
### OBJECTIVES:
   *   The primary principle of our project is to promote health care without getting the user  in any mess and to increase awareness of          various affordable government programs among the unaware people 
   *   Connecting patient to doctors even in the remote areas.
   *   To identify best suitable specialist for the given patient
   *   An organized structure to approach a doctor
   *   Improve doctor and patient interpersonal communication gap
   *   Specially for Lazy people (Not conscious about their health)
